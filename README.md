# DectalkNET
 Allows you to use the DECtalk voice sythesizer directly in .NET applications without having to run `say.exe`
 
## Instructions
 To be able to actually build this project you'll need to put `dectalk.dll` and `dtalk_us.dic` *(which you can get from [here](https://github.com/RickyLoader/DectalkAPI/tree/master/dectalk-software))* into the `\DectalkNET` directory
